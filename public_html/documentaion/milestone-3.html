                    As a full-stack developer in training, I have discovered the components of coding and how various parts work together to make web applications run. I have become familiar with the various technologies used in modern web development with a focus on Front-end with HTML, CSS and React. I have a foundation in JavaScript stack plus the latest technologies including Git, MySQL and software architecture principles.
                    I have an abundance of experience in Version Control with Git and Github, using relational databases with MySQL, Application Deployment, DevOps, and containerization using Docker. I have discovered many benefits and capabilities of the agile project management working along side classmates working together as a team to deliver value early and consistently throughout projects.
                    I am a full time mother of two children, primary provider spending my free time exercising, drawing, messing around with my watercolors, and now coding!! Join me on my journey into the wide , world of professional development! I will chronicle the process of creating applications, add any new insights into the tech community in Albuquerque that I learn, and share resources that I am using on my journey.
