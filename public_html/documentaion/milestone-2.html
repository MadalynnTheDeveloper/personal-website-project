    <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
        This project will be a professional portfolio website with a focus on front-end web development more than just a description of your work, but showing it is my work. This site will be designed for a professional audience where I can demonstrate what I am capable of as a full stack developer targeting user experience.
       I want my welcome to be extremely inviting including a photo of the city I reside placing my name as a full stack developer.<p>

I will provide my interest and hobbies, my passion for technology and how it led me to apply for an immersive bootcamp here at CNM. I will include a photo of myself to add personality to my site plus it will remind people that they're hiring an actual human and not just a faceless developer behind a computer screen. I will inculde all languages learned in the bootcamp and displayed through my work provided to review.</p>
